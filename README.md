# **push_swap**

## **About**
Project from Rank 02 of 42 Porto Common Core. It's about exploring sorting algorithms and trying to sort a list of numbers.
The least number of movements the better.

## [Section I Want]

## **Mandatory**
Read and sort a valid list of numbers.
A valid list would be: 45 -12 5 0 23 or "82 -2 928 -32 43 2"
Anything else is handled as an error.

## **Bonus**

## **Usage**
Compile using `make` and run `push_swap` with your list of numbers.
```sh
$ ./push_swap 45 -12 5 0 23
```
or
```sh
$ ./push_swap "82 -2 928 -32 43 2"
```

For the bonus `make bonus` and run `checker`.
Here you're in charge of choosing the moves out of the [Heading Link](#section-i-want)
```sh
$ .
```
